# Credit Scoring Prototype

## Overview
This project is a credit scoring prototype that leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the process of loading and preprocessing data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models.

<!-- ## Folder Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
credit-scoring-prototype/
├── notebooks/
│   └── credit_scoring_demo.ipynb   # Original Jupyter notebook
├── src/
│   ├── data_processing.py          # Data loading and preprocessing script
│   ├── eda.py                      # Exploratory Data Analysis script
│   ├── modeling.py                 # Model training and evaluation script
├── tests/                          # Directory for unit tests (empty for now)
├── data/                           # Directory for datasets (add your dataset here)
├── README.md                       # Project overview and usage instructions
